Order a burrito from chipotle with the cli!

Interesting way to gain some knowledge of casper.js for integration testing.

This program really does place an order!  Don't abuse.

## Prerequisites

A Chipotle account

Then run...

`brew install phantomjs`

`brew install casperjs --devel`

## Getting Started

Install with: `sudo npm install burritotime -g`


## Documentation

New order or first time simply type: `burritotime` and the program will guide you through making your burrito selections.

At the end of your order you will be prompted to save these preferences in a config file.

If you would like to order from an existing config file, simply type the burritotime command and the name of your config file: `burritotime myway`
